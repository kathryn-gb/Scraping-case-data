# Scraping-case-data

My friend was spending hours every week slowly accumulating case data for her job - by copying and pasting from fields on an older website. I offered to see if I could automate the task, saving her dozens of hours and expediting the finish date. Because this was a one-off solution I was doing on my spare time, I didn't adorn my work with the usual care for documentation and reproducability. However, I think it's a worthwhile example of how I like to use my skills to help others - and do "magic", as she called it!
